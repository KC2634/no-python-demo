# no-python-demo
Trying to code in Python without local installed

User documentation:
Using this [Link](https://potential-space-fortnight-4qwr65pj99p37x96.github.dev/) answer the questions of my quiz. 
You will be asked 4 questions, answer them as accurately as you can and for each question you will be told wether you are right or wrong.

Technical Documentation:
The code starts with print fucntions to start the quiz
Then question 1 is asked to the user, by defining my function def my_function(user_answer): 
Then the if fucntion is used to demonstarte if the user states the right asnwer the text "that is correct!" is displayed.
This is then repeated for questions 2 and 3
For the end of the quiz I used a print fucntion to tell the user it was the end of the quiz.
